I did not have time to do the "Daily revenue and daily number of trips comparison against last 4 “same weekdays” average and against “entire previous week (last 7 days)” average"

In this point "Daily number of trips, filterable by pickup and by drop off" I did the average daily number of trips. 

I also didn't understand the diference between deliveries and orders.

The file is not the prettiest, but I did my best with the time I had.
